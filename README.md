# **AssetPilot: Money Moves Made Easy 💸**

**AssetPilot** is your smart finance companion designed to track everything you borrow or lend — not just cash, but also tangible assets like gold, silver, and utilities. Stay organized, monitor due dates, get performance ratings, and earn milestones for responsible asset management.

### **1. Unified Dashboard**

Get an instant overview of your financial exchanges. View your **Total Lent**, **Total Borrowed**, and the number of **Pending Returns** in one place.

Stay motivated with progress-based achievements! Earn badges like:

* **Streak Master** – 10 on-time repayments in a row
* **Debt Slayer** – Cleared all debts in a single month
* **Trust Badge** – 100% on-time repayments for 6 months

### **5. Detailed Statistics**

Visualize your financial activity with interactive charts:

* **Lent Asset Type Distribution** (Cash, Gold, Silver, Utilities)
