AssetPilot: Money Moves Made Easy 💸

AssetPilot is your smart finance companion designed to track everything you borrow or lend, not just cash, but also tangible assets like gold, silver, and utilities. Stay organized, track due dates, get a performance rating, and earn milestones for responsible asset management.

✨ Key Features

1. Unified Dashboard
Get an immediate overview of your financial exchanges. The dashboard clearly displays your Total Lent, Total Borrowed, and the number of Pending Returns.
2. Smart Calendar Tracking
Never miss a due date again. The integrated Smart Calendar highlights important dates for both repayment (borrowed assets) and payment requests (lent assets) at a glance.
3. Performance Report & Trust Score
Analyze your asset management performance with a dedicated report page. It calculates your Trust Score based on your repayment history: On-Time, Early, and Late Repayments.
4. Milestones & Badges
Earn badges as you manage your assets responsibly and hit financial goals. Badges like "Streak Master" (10 on-time repayments in a row), "Debt Slayer" (cleared all debts in a single month), and "Trust Badge" (100% on-time repayment for 6 months) motivate consistent performance.
5. Detailed Statistics
Visualize your asset distribution with multiple charts, including:
    Lent Asset Type Distribution (e.g., Cash, Gold, Silver, Utilities)
    Outstanding v/s Settled Amounts
    Borrowed Asset Type Distribution

🛠️ Technology Stack

📝 Usage

Recording a Transaction
    From the Home or Dashboard page, click the "Borrow" or "Lend" button.
    A modal will appear for recording the asset. Fill in the required details:
        Asset Type (Utility, Cash, Gold, Silver, Loan)
        Amount
        Borrowed From / Lent To
        Deadline
        Interest Rate (Input field available)
        Category (Emergency, Personal, Investment, Loan)
    Click "Submit". The new transaction is immediately reflected on your Dashboard and Calendar.

Marking as Returned
    On the Dashboard, active transactions are listed under the "Transactions" section.
    To mark a debt as settled, click the green checkmark button (✔) next to the transaction.
    The transaction is then moved to the History section, and its status (Early, Late, or On-Time) is calculated based on the repayment date against the deadline.
